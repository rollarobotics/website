    <h1>What is Rolla Robotics?</h1>
    <p>Rolla Robotics is a collective of three teams that participate annually in  the FIRST FTC program. FIRST stands for &quot;For Inspiration and Recognition  of Science and Technology.&quot; The goal of FIRST is to inspire young people  to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based  programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire  innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including  self-confidence, communication, and leadership. One aspect of FIRST is FTC,  which stands for &quot;FIRST Tech Challenge.&quot; This is where interested  high school students can form a team where they are responsible for designing,  building and programming a robot to compete in an alliance format against other  teams.  Awards are given for the  competition as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world  accomplishments. Please visit <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">www3.usfirst.org</a> to learn more.</p>
    <p><br />
      All Three teams are based in the Rolla Community and do their best to  promote FIRST through collaboration with local businesses, other FTC teams, and  school activites.</p>
